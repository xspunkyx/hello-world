# hello-world
Just another respository

Hi my name is Jim, with this edit I am learning about Github. I have created a personal portfolio and would like to host my site on Github pages. I've been teaching myself how to code for awhile now and would like to start posting my projects on here. I also love eating korean bbq and drinking boba. 

What I learned from creating this repository: 

*Created an open source repository
*Started and managed a new branch
*Changed a file and committed those changes to GitHub
*Opened and merged a Pull Request
